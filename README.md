# CANSifter
Sifts two different blf files to find the differing CAN signals or messages between them. Currently only works with one channel at a time.

The requirements for the script to work are:
  -One DBC file
  -Two different .blf files that you would like to compare
  -The correct channel of the CAN network you are trying to read

Things to do about this:
  -currently the output signals and messsages do not spefiy which log they are missing from
  -The later variables are poorly named
  -Add UI at somepoint?
